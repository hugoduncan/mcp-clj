# MCP-CLJ Project Scope

## Project Overview

MCP-CLJ is a Clojure implementation of the Model-Channel Protocol (MCP)
defined by Anthropic. The project provides both client and server
components for MCP communication, with a specific focus on exposing
Clojure REPL functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation
- Implementation of the MCP protocol specification as defined by Anthropic
- Support for MCP message formats and communication patterns
- Protocol version compatibility management

### 2. Client Component
- MCP client implementation for connecting to MCP servers
- Client-side message handling and protocol operations
- Error handling and connection management

### 3. Server Component
- MCP server implementation for accepting client connections
- Server-side message handling and protocol operations
- Connection management and client session handling

### 4. Clojure REPL Integration
- REPL session management
- Code evaluation capabilities
- REPL state management
- Output capturing and formatting

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- MCP protocol implementation (client and server)
- Basic Clojure REPL functionality
- Core message handling and communication
- Standard error handling and reporting
- Basic session management

### Out of Scope
- Advanced IDE features
- Code analysis tools
- Debugging facilities
- Performance monitoring tools
- Security features beyond basic protocol requirements

## Dependencies
- Clojure 1.12.0
- JSON-RPC component (local)
- Testing frameworks (Kaocha)

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Anthropic's MCP specification
- Focus on simplicity and core functionality
- Minimize external dependencies
- Maintain clear separation between protocol and REPL concerns

## Success Criteria
1. Successful implementation of MCP protocol specification
2. Reliable client-server communication
3. Functional Clojure REPL integration
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Clear documentation of usage and features

## Future Considerations
While out of current scope, the following areas may be considered for
future development:
- Enhanced REPL features
- Additional development tools
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- Extended protocol features

This scope is subject to revision as requirements evolve or as new needs
are identified.
