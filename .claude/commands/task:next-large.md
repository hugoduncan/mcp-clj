description: Find and work on the next incomplete Large task
---
Read .claude/TASKS.md, identify the next incomplete task (marked with [
]) in the 'Large' section, and begin working on it.

  - Show the task description
  - analyse the task spec in the context of the project.
    Research any design patterns or exemplars that are mentioned. Do not
    expand the scope, but do list any aspects the user may have
    forgotten to mention.
  - if the item is marked REFINE, then refine the spec, making it more
	explicit and removing ambiguity. If the refactoring calls for a
	something standard e.g. a common design pattern, then research best
	practices for that. Do no expand the scope. Show the refined
	specification, including aspects that you have considered but
	excluded. Ask the user for feedback about the specification. Pause
	before continuing
  - stop and check with the user that you have understood the spec
  - design an implementation first
  - plan an implementation
  - implement
  - update the task to mark as done
  - commit
