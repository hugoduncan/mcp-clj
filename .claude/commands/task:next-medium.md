description: Execute the next incomplete Medium task
---
Read .claude/TASKS.md, identify the next incomplete task (marked with [
]) in the 'Medium' section, and begin working on it:

  - Show the task description
  - analyse the task spec in the context of the project.
    Research any design patterns or exemplars that are mentioned. Do not
    expand the scope, but do list any aspects the user may have
    forgotten to mention.
  - stop and check with the user that you have understood the spec
  - plan an implementation
  - implement
  - update the task to mark as done
  - commit
